drunk_simulator_for_playing_computer_games
==========================================
This basically takes over your (windows based) computer and lets you play "as if you were drunk"

Basically start up the program, then run any game on the computer.  Your keyboard input will be
randomly delayed and you will learn what it's like to drive like a drunk.

Even simple games display this wonderfully:

Useful for teaching kids why *not* to drink, etc.
NB that it's good to disable the keyboard "repeat delay" before using this.

To install it, you'll need to run the file "keys.reg" contained first, then next reboot.

TODO: put keys.reg into an installer script so we can get the admin stuf goin' on.
